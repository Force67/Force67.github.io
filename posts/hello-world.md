This is where it starts.

I've been meaning to write more—about systems, AI tooling, the things I'm building. Not polished essays, just about things *I* find interesting.

## What to expect

Mostly technical stuff:

- Notes on Rust, C++, and systems programming
- AI/LLM engineering observations
- Things I learned from emulation and modding projects and reverse engineering countless games over the years (see the Projects section on the home page)
- The occasional rant about developer experience

## Why now

I've been building in public for years through code. Writing is for sure more slower and deliberate - but maybe some people out here enjoy my ramblings.

Let's see where this goes.
